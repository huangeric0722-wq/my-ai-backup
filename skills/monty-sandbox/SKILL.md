# Monty Sandbox Skill

This skill provides a secure interface to execute Python code using the Monty interpreter.
**Note:** This is a conceptual prototype based on 2026-02-07 research. Actual `monty` binary integration required.

## Usage

```bash
# Execute a python script securely
monty run script.py

# Execute a specific function with inputs
monty call script.py --func calculate --args '{"x": 10}'
```

## Security Features (Planned)
- No network access (unless explicitly allowlisted)
- Filesystem isolation (read-only mounts)
- CPU/Memory limits
- Microsecond startup time

## Installation (TODO)
- Need to compile `monty` from source or fetch pre-built binary.
- Add to OpenClaw path.
